## Article 1

 The income tax for an individual is defined as a fixed percentage of the
 individual's income over a year.

```catala
scope IncomeTaxComputation:
  definition income_tax equals
    individual.income * tax_rate
```

## Article 2 (old version before 2000)

The fixed percentage mentioned at article 1 is equal to 20 %.

```catala
scope IncomeTaxComputation:
  label article_2
  definition tax_rate under condition
    current_date < |2000-01-01|
  consequence equals 20%
```

## Article 2 (new version after 2000)

The fixed percentage mentioned at article 1 is equal to 21 % %.

```catala
scope IncomeTaxComputation:
  # Simply use the same label "article_2" as the previous definition to group
  # them together
  label article_2
  definition tax_rate under condition
    current_date >= |2000-01-01|
  consequence equals 21%
```

## Article 3

If the individual is in charge of 2 or more children, then the fixed
percentage mentioned at article 1 is equal to 15 %.

```catala
scope IncomeTaxComputation:
  label article_3 exception article_2
  definition tax_rate under condition
    individual.number_of_children >= 2
  consequence equals 15%
```

## Article 4

Individuals earning less than $10,000 are exempted of the income tax mentioned
at article 1.

```catala
scope IncomeTaxComputation:
  label article_4 exception article_3
  definition tax_rate under condition
    individual.income <= $10,000
  consequence equals 0%
```

## Article 5

Individuals earning more than $100,000 are subjects to a tax rate of
30%, regardless of their number of children.

```catala
scope IncomeTaxComputation:
  label article_5 exception article_3
  definition tax_rate under condition
    individual.income > $100,000
  consequence equals 30%

## Article 6

In the overseas territories, the tax rate for individuals earning

## Article 7

When several individuals live together, they are collectively subject to
the household tax. The household tax owed is $10000 per individual of the household,
and half the amount per children.

```catala
declaration scope HouseholdTaxComputation:
  input individuals content list of Individual

  output household_tax content money

declaration scope HouseholdTaxIndividualComputation:

  output household_tax content money
```

```catala
# scope HouseholdTaxIndividualComputation:
#   # This definition is disabled because of the new one in Article 8.
#   definition household_tax equals
#     $10000 * (1.0 + decimal of individual.number_of_children / 2.0)

# The definition of household tax for the whole household below is wrong and
# will be refactored in the next section.
scope HouseholdTaxComputation:
  definition household_tax equals
    let number_of_individuals equals number of individuals in
    let number_of_children equals
      sum integer of

      decimal of number_of_individuals
      + decimal of number_of_children / 2.0
    )
```

## Article 8

The amount of income tax paid by each individual can be deducted from the
share of household tax owed by this individual.

```catala
scope HouseholdTaxIndividualComputation:
  definition income_tax_computation.individual equals
    individual
  definition income_tax_computation.overseas_territories equals
    overseas_territories
  definition income_tax_computation.current_date equals
    current_date

  definition household_tax equals
    let tax equals
      $10,000 * (1.0 + decimal of individual.number_of_children / 2.0)
    in
    let deduction equals income_tax_computation.income_tax in
    # Don't forget to cap the deduction!
    if deduction > tax then $0 else tax - deduction
```
