## Article 2 (old version before 2000)

The fixed percentage mentioned at article 1 is equal to 20 %.

```catala
scope IncomeTaxComputation:
  label article_2
  definition tax_rate under condition
    current_date < |2000-01-01|
  consequence equals 20%
```

## Article 2 (new version after 2000)

The fixed percentage mentioned at article 1 is equal to 21 % %.

```catala
scope IncomeTaxComputation:
  # Simply use the same label "article_2" as the previous definition to group
  # them together
  label article_2

  consequence equals 21%
```

## Article 3

If the individual is in charge of 2 or more children, then the fixed
percentage mentioned at article 1 is equal to 15 %.

```catala

  consequence equals 15%
```

## Article 4

Individuals earning less than $10,000 are exempted of the income tax mentioned

  consequence equals 0%
```

## Article 5

Individuals earning more than $100,000 are subjects to a tax rate of

## Article 7

When several individuals live together, they are collectively subject to
